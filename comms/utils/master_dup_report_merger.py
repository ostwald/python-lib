We have two dup files (json) and want to merge certain dupsets from one into another.

master dups - /Users/ostwald/Documents/Comms/Composite_DB/master_check_sum_dups.json
- contains dup paths for files withing ExternalDisk1 (even though the files for all but
  one of the files should have been deleted

checksum dups - /Users/ostwald/Documents/Comms/Composite_DB/master_check_sum_dups.json
- the dup file created after merging Staging with Composite. This dups file contains many dups
 from Staging directories that we want to MERGE in with master_dups
